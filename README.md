The code must be run under Python 3 (i.e. not 2.7 or earlier).

To start a local CGI server for testing, 
open a command window and type:


cd ong_python 
python -m http.server --cgi --bind localhost 8000

(or possibly python3 if you have two versions installed).  
Then visit in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/UI.py
